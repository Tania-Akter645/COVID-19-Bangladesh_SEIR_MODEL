# COVID-19 SEIR Modeling and Forecasting for Bangladesh

This project analyzes and forecasts the spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh using the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) epidemiological model.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/` — Raw COVID-19-Bangladesh data
- `preprocessing.py` — Clean and transform the data
- `exploratory_analysis.py` — Visualize infection trends, mortality, and more
- `seir_simulation.py` — SEIR model simulation with fitted parameters
- `forecasting_SEIR.py` — Forecast future COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh
- `report/` — Figures and charts used for final report

## 📊 Features
- Data preprocessing and rate calculations
- SEIR simulation with curve fitting
- Forecasting using differential equations
- Visual trend analysis with matplotlib

## 📦 Requirements
Install packages with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

✅ Usage
Run the following files as needed:

python preprocessing.py
python exploratory_analysis.py
